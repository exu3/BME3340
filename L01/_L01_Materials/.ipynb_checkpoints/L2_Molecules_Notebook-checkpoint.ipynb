    "Our goal is to introduce the notebook style of this course and to build familiarity with protein structure and sequence files while gaining  intuition into the utility of protein structures. In part 1, we will visualize protein structures and determine if we can say anything about the protein's function. In part 2, we will then search for the proteins using their amino acid sequence to check their actual function. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will take a look at several protein structures. These structures were predicted automatically from alphafold and were downloaded from the [AlphaFold database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of files that we will work with here (.pdb and .fasta files). Both of these files are plain text files (you can open them in any text editor). Each file has a standard format for the information it represents.\n",
    "* .pdb files: protein structure, this file specifies the coordinates of each atom in each amino acid of the protein\n",
    "* .fasta files: protein sequence, this file lists the amino acid sequence of the protein (Note: .fasta files can contain either amino acid or nucleotide sequences)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first load the .pdb files and visulaize the protein structures. Next we will load the .fasta files and search the NCBI database via BLAST to identify the protein."

We will search until we find 10 total matches. We will save our BLAST results as an .xml file and then load them and print out all of the matches below a specified e-value.
